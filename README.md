# Setting Up and Using the API

To set up and use the RESTful API for the simple blogging platform, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository from GitHub.
   - Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure the database settings in the `.env` file.
   - Set up authentication mechanisms like JWT tokens or OAuth in the authentication configuration file.

3. **Starting the API:**
   - Run the API server using the command `npm start`.
   - Ensure that the server is running on the specified port (e.g., 3000).

4. **Testing Endpoints:**
   - Use tools like Postman to test each endpoint for CRUD operations on blog posts.
   - Send requests to endpoints like `GET /posts`, `POST /posts`, `PUT /posts/:id`, and `DELETE /posts/:id`.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Refer to the comprehensive API documentation provided in the `docs` folder for detailed information on each endpoint.
   - Explore examples of sample requests and responses to understand how to interact with the API effectively.
